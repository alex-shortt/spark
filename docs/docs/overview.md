*Forge aims to expand what's possible with Gaussian Splatting and help 3D/4D creators bring their visions to life and share it with others.*

# Overview

Forge is a dynamic Gaussian splat (Gsplat) renderer built on Three.js. It renders Gsplat-based worlds and objects into Three.js scenes, giving you the ability to fuse AI-generated with photogrammetry and regular triangle meshes. Forge is also programmable and fully dynamic, giving you unprecedented control over how Gsplat elements are generated and rendered into the scene.

## Features
- Render multiple splat objects together with correct sorting
- Integrates with Three.js rendering pipeline to fuse Gsplat + mesh-based objects
- Portable: Works across almost all devices, targeting 98%+ WebGL2 support
- Fast! Renders fast even on low-powered mobile devices
- File format support: all major formats supported including .PLY (including compressed), .SPZ, .SPLAT, .KSPLAT
- Render multiple viewpoints simultaneously
- Fully dynamic: each Gsplat can be transformed and edited for animation
- Real-time Gsplat color editing and skeletal animation
- Shader graph system to dynamically create/edit Gsplats on the GPU
